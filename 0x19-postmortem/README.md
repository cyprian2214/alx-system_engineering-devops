Postmortem: Database Performance Degradation Incident
Issue Summary:
	Duration: May 15, 2024, from 10:00 AM to 12:30 PM (EDT)
	Impact: The primary user database experienced significant performance degradation, causing slow response times for 60% of users. Affected users experienced delays of up to 10 seconds when accessing the service.
	Root Cause: A misconfigured database index on a high-traffic table led to inefficient query execution, severely impacting performance.
Timeline:
	10:00 AM: Issue detected via automated monitoring alert indicating increased response times.
	10:05 AM: Initial investigation by the on-call engineer confirmed the degradation in database performance.
	10:10 AM: Assumed the issue was due to high traffic volume; scaled up application servers.
	10:30 AM: Traffic assumption proved incorrect; database queries continued to lag.
	10:45 AM: Noticed high CPU usage on the primary database server.
	11:00 AM: Database team escalated the issue; began examining recent changes to the database schema.
	11:15 AM: Misleading path: suspected a potential network issue between application servers and the database.
	11:30 AM: Further investigation ruled out network issues; focused back on database performance.
	11:45 AM: Identified recent index change on a high-traffic table as the probable cause.
	12:00 PM: Reverted the index change; observed immediate improvement in query performance.
	12:30 PM: Full service restoration confirmed; performance metrics returned to normal.
Root Cause and Resolution:
	Root Cause: The root cause was an inefficient index configuration on a frequently accessed table. A recent database schema update introduced a new index intended to optimize query performance. However, this index was not optimized for the actual query patterns, leading to full table scans instead of the intended index lookups.
	Resolution: The issue was resolved by reverting the index to its previous configuration. After the reversion, query performance returned to normal as the database resumed using the optimized index paths.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements:
	Enhance pre-deployment testing to include query performance benchmarks.
	Implement automated alerts for abnormal increases in query execution times.
	Conduct regular review sessions of database schema changes with a focus on performance impact.
Tasks:
	Task 1: Develop and integrate a comprehensive query performance monitoring tool.
	Task 2: Create a standardized procedure for evaluating and approving database schema changes.
	Task 3: Conduct training sessions for the engineering team on database indexing best practices.
	Task 4: Add detailed logging for database query execution times and patterns.
	Task 5: Schedule bi-weekly review meetings to discuss recent database changes and their impact.
By implementing these measures, we aim to prevent similar issues in the future and ensure more robust database performance management.
