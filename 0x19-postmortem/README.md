# Postmortem: The Great Database Debacle of 2024

## Issue Summary
- **Duration:** May 15, 2024, from 10:00 AM to 12:30 PM (EDT)
- **Impact:** Users experienced response times that made molasses in January seem fast—60% of our users were affected, waiting up to 10 seconds per query.
- **Root Cause:** A well-intentioned, but ultimately disastrous, database index misconfiguration.

## Timeline
- **10:00 AM:** *ALERT!* Automated monitoring starts screaming about response times.
- **10:05 AM:** On-call engineer, eyes still blurry from coffee, confirms: things are slooow.
- **10:10 AM:** “It’s the traffic!” they shout. More servers deployed.
- **10:30 AM:** Servers scaled, yet users still wait... and wait... and wait.
- **10:45 AM:** Primary database server is working harder than a cat trying to avoid a bath.
- **11:00 AM:** Database team, capes on, dive into the mystery.
- **11:15 AM:** “Maybe it’s a network issue?” they ponder. Nope.
- **11:30 AM:** Network fine, eyes back on the database. Light bulb moment approaching!
- **11:45 AM:** Suspicious new index found, recent as Aunt Marge’s potato salad.
- **12:00 PM:** Index rolled back. Queue instant relief.
- **12:30 PM:** All systems go! Users happy. Engineers slightly traumatized but wiser.

## Root Cause and Resolution
**Root Cause:** The problem stemmed from a new database index that was supposed to speed things up but instead threw a spanner in the works. This index, intended to optimize queries, caused full table scans, turning our database into a lumbering giant.

**Resolution:** Rolling back the offending index restored our database’s former glory. As soon as the old index was reinstated, query performance snapped back to normal, and the users could once again frolic through our service unimpeded.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
**What We Can Improve:**
- Implement better pre-deployment query performance benchmarks.
- Set up automated alerts for unusual query execution times.
- Regularly review schema changes for performance impacts.

**Tasks:**
- **Task 1:** Develop and integrate a comprehensive query performance monitoring tool. 
  - *Status:* In progress
  - ![Progress Chart](https://www.example.com/progress-chart.png)
- **Task 2:** Standardize procedures for evaluating and approving database schema changes. 
  - *Status:* To be started
- **Task 3:** Conduct training on database indexing best practices. 
  - *Status:* Scheduled
- **Task 4:** Add detailed logging for database query times and patterns. 
  - *Status:* Completed
- **Task 5:** Schedule bi-weekly review meetings for recent database changes. 
  - *Status:* In progress

### Conclusion
To prevent another database disaster, we've taken a comprehensive approach to bolster our systems and processes. Our engineers, now armed with lessons learned and a touch of PTSD, are ready to ensure smoother sailing ahead. Keep your eyes peeled for more thrilling tales from the trenches of tech!
